# FirePM-V1.0
The first Version of the Building Fire Performance Monitoring tool developed in WPI

This software is designed to help you to do sensiivity analysis and parametric analysis about the evolution of the building fire performance based on the updating of chronically changed input variables.

This repository include the source codes, the executable files/tools, and an example case including all the data you need to run the tools. Note that only the *devc.csv generated from the FDS simulations are included to save the space. That said, you can just run all the 4 tools to get a flavor about the FirePM without taking a long time to run many FDS simulations. Once you are familar with how FirePM works, you can start to cope with your own project.
